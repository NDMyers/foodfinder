This repo is an application I have previously written that is fully functional and provides the user with a location-based food finding application that provides filters and utilizes google maps API to provide restaurant location data. 

I would like to revamp this application stylistically and use the opportunity to enhance any inefficient processes, clean up security issues and overall make the app just a bit better.

Perform an audit of the application, with my permission to use your premier front-end skills to suggest full redesign of the application (maintaining the core features). Use any of your other applicable skills in tightening up our security. 

Don't feel like you have to have a similar style to what I had previously (except the confetti for the random select portion of which restaurant is selected, I liked that). 

A simple guideline would be something aesthetically clean, perfect for mobile and desktop views and applicable to be transferred to a mobile deployment for android or iOS - responsive design is a given. Use modern-day best practice nextjs, typescript, tailwindcss, framer-motion design principles and make the application look great!

Ensure you use a linter to check any issues in files and fix them as you go.
